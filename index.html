      <h1>Welcome to the MBTA Project</h1>
        <p>
        Throughout our time as Boston students, we have experienced many issues with Boston’s transportation system. 
        From unreliable predictions on T and bus arrivals to waiting upwards of 30 minutes for the next bus to arrive,
        Boston students are all too familiar with the uncertainty surrounding public transit. Our visualizations aim 
        to discover the distribution of predicted versus actual arrival times across Boston, find hotspots of 
        inefficiency, and prevent the pain of stranding ourselves. These visualizations will allow students to 
        confidently leave Snell that extra crucial minute later, or even avoid trouble spots entirely, opting for 
        more sure routes. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Using our identified datasets, we aim to map how often the mass dot website accurately predicts the true 
        arrival time of the MBTA Orange Line. Additionally, we will aim to graph how many minutes, on average, the Mass DOT predicted 
        time is off from the true departure time.
